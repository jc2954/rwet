       " There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put\n",

       " I\n",
       " shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\n",

       " to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\n",
       " a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\n",
       " eye.,\n",
       " This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.,\n",
       " I\n",
       " have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\n",
       " been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\n",
       " through the seas which surround the pole.,\n",
       " You may remember that a\n",

       " whole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library.,\n",
       " My education was neglected,,\n",
       " yet I was passionately fond of reading.,\n",
       " These volumes were my study\n",

       " had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.,\n",
       " \n",
       " \n",
       " These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\n",
       " whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.,\n",
       " I also\n",
       " became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;\n",

       " I\n",
       " accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;\n",

       " worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my\n",
       " nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those\n",
       " branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive\n",
       " the greatest practical advantage.,\n",
       " Twice I actually hired myself as an\n",
       " under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration.,\n",
       " I\n",
       " must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\n",
       " dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\n",
       " earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.,\n",
       " \n",

       " And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?,\n",
       " \n",
       " My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to\n",
       " every enticement that wealth placed in my path.,\n",
       " Oh, that some encouraging\n",
       " voice would answer in the affirmative!,\n",
       " My courage and my resolution is\n",
       " firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed.,\n",
       " I am\n",
       " about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which\n",
       " will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits\n",

       " This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia.,\n",

       " my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach.,\n",
       " The\n",
       " cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have\n",

       " My aunt observed\n",
       " this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother\n",
       " to allow her to live at our house.,\n",
       " The republican institutions of our\n",
       " country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which\n",
       " prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.,\n",
       " Hence there is less\n",
       " distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the\n",
       " lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are\n",
       " more refined and moral.,\n",
       " A servant in Geneva does not mean the same\n",
       " thing as a servant in France and England.,\n",
       " Justine, thus received in\n",
       " our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our\n",
       " fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a\n",

       " you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.,\n",
       " ,\n",
       " Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,\n",
       " yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.,\n",
