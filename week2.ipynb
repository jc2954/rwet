He believed the pysical things happend in this world was by \"incidence\" or \"accidentally\". Computer generated poems can be beautiful and bring pleasue. \n",

    "\"In keeping with the idea of juxtaposition, modern poets somtime talk about the peom not as process or speech so much as composition. Poets who do so are usually thinkg in tersm of an analogy with visual arts. The artist'sjob is to compose, to place together in a meaningful arangemnt a number of independent elements. Paninters compose planes of color, shapes, collaged objects and so on. The poet's equivalents might be words, lines, phrases, quotations - any pieces of speech that can be treated as seperable and rearranged in some poetic \"space\".\"\n",
